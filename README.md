# Campus-Nav: 3D Interactive Campus Navigation System

## Introduction
**Campus-Nav** is a sophisticated 3D interactive map application tailored for campus navigation.
This tool provides real-time location tracking and searchable points of interest to facilitate navigation for students, faculty, and visitors. 
Using Three.js for 3D rendering and QGIS2threejs for GIS data integration, Campus-Nav offers an intuitive interface for exploring campus layouts.

## Features
- **Real-Time Location Tracking:** Uses geolocation to show the user's current position on the 3D campus map, improving navigation and orientation.
- **Searchable Points of Interest:** Enables users to locate buildings, faculty offices, student services, and classrooms quickly.
- **Interactive 3D Visualization:** Users can interact with the 3D campus model, utilizing controls to zoom, pan, and rotate for different views.

## Deployment
Campus-Nav is hosted on GitHub Pages, allowing users to experience its features live and understand the practical application of GIS and 3D modeling in educational environments.

## Technical Overview
The application is developed using:
- **Three.js:** A JavaScript library that displays animated 3D graphics in the web browser, using WebGL.
- **QGIS2threejs:** A plugin for QGIS that exports geographical data to WebGL-compatible formats, integrating real-world terrain into web applications.
- **IndexedDB:** Utilized for efficient data storage and retrieval on the client side, facilitating robust data management and state persistence across sessions.
